# ello :D

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I mostly mess around with projects for fun and learning. No big agenda—just code, coffee, and curiosity.

## Projects

Here are a few things I've made:

- **OGFImg** – OGF Image/tile downloader and stitcher, now also lets you download some OGF map layers!
- **Wikisoft** - Currently just using a name I pased in instead of the real on accident but its a bare-bones wiki stored in txt files but saved as my own slightly changed version of markdown. 
- **Minitracker** – A website that is still very buggy but tracks Roblox games stats. Based on Rolimons and made to track the games they wont.
- **HDYCTOGF** – A very quickly made tool to see how did you contribute to OpenGeofiction? Was mainly made with ChatGPT and was really more for fun then for anything functional
