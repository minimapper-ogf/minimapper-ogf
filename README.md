# ello :D

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I mostly mess around with projects for fun and learning. No big agenda—just code, coffee, and curiosity.

## Projects

Here are a few things I've made:

- 🔧 **OGFImg** – OGF Image/tile downloader and stitcher, now also lets you download some OGF map layers!
- 🎮 **HDYCTOGF** – A very quickly made tool to see how did you contribute to OpenGeofiction? Was mainly made with ChatGPT and was really more for fun then for anything functional
- 🤖 **Minitracker** – A website that is still very buggy but tracks Roblox games stats. Based on Rolimons and made to track the games they wont.
- 🗂️ **Mishota Wiki** – Its just a wiki for my state of Mishota on Opengeofiction.net
